# Weather_api
First time using the python requests libraty. This is a simple demo that will print out the weather in a given area based off your lat and long.
This code will ask for GPS coords, call the weather.gov api service to get gridpoints of your location. After getting your gridpoints it will call another weather.gov api to get hourly weather data. That weather data is then parsed and printed.
